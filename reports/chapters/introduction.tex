\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:into} % This how you label a chapter and the key (e.g., ch:into) will be used to refer this chapter ``Introduction'' later in the report. 
% the key ``ch:into'' can be used with command \ref{ch:intor} to refere this Chapter.

With the rise in the digital age, the chances of online fraud have also increased significantly. Credit cards have become an integral part of financial transactions which facilitates online transactions more easily and it is also convenient for customers. However, with an increase in the use of such online transactions, there is an increase in the risk of fraud which leads to huge losses for both customers and financial institutions. Credit card fraud happens when an unidentified user makes the transaction using someone elseâ€™s card information and detecting such fraud manually is a very challenging task due to such a high number of transactions every moment. To deal with this cybercrime, an efficient fraud detection system \cite{DORNADULA2019631} should be established which uses various machine learning algorithms and models to accurately detect the fraud. In this, a credit card fraud detection dataset  is taken from an online source kaggle where the data is cleaned and processed to extract relevant information which can be used as training data for the machine learning models to accurately detect the fraud. Some machine learning algorithms \cite{refId0} that are used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, and Random forest classification which can detect fraud based on the data of past transactions and can detect fraud in real-time which is a big advantage of using machine learning algorithms. It evaluates the output based on various factors like location, date and time of the transaction, past transactions, etc. These algorithms ensure safer transactions by improving the security by learning from the training datasets.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:into_back}
Describe to a reader the context of your project. That is, what is your project and what its motivation. Briefly explain the major theories, applications, and/or products/systems/algorithms whichever is relevant to your project.

\textbf{Cautions:} Do not say you choose this project because of your interest, or your supervisor proposed/suggested this project, or you were assigned this project as your final year project. This all may be true, but it is not meant to be written here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:intro_prob_art}
This section describes the investigated problem in detail. You can also have a separate chapter on ``Problem articulation.''  For some projects, you may have a section like ``Research question(s)'' or ``Research Hypothesis'' instead of a section on ``Problem statement.'

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Aims and objectives}
\label{sec:intro_aims_obj}
Describe the ``aims and objectives'' of your project. 

\textbf{Aims:} The aims tell a read what you want/hope to achieve at the end of the project. The  aims define your intent/purpose in general terms.  

\textbf{Objectives:} The objectives are a set of tasks you would perform in order to achieve the defined aims. The objective statements have to be specific and measurable through the results and outcome of the project.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution approach}
\label{sec:intro_sol} % label of Org section
Briefly describe the solution approach and the methodology applied in solving the set aims and objectives.

Depending on the project, you may like to alter the ``heading'' of this section. Check with you supervisor. Also, check what subsection or any other section that can be added in or removed from this template.

\subsection{A subsection 1}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub1}
You may or may not need subsections here. Depending on your project's needs, add two or more subsection(s). A section takes at least two subsections. 

\subsection{A subsection 2}
\label{sec:intro_some_sub2}
Depending on your project's needs, add more section(s) and subsection(s).

\subsubsection{A subsection 1 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub1}
The command \textbackslash subsubsection\{\} creates a paragraph heading in \LaTeX.

\subsubsection{A subsection 2 of a subsection}
\label{sec:intro_some_subsub2}
Write your text here...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary of contributions and achievements} %  use this section 
\label{sec:intro_sum_results} % label of summary of results
Describe clearly what you have done/created/achieved and what the major results and their implications are. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Organization of the report} %  use this section
\label{sec:intro_org} % label of Org section
Describe the outline of the rest of the report here. Let the reader know what to expect ahead in the report. Describe how you have organized your report. 

\textbf{Example: how to refer a chapter, section, subsection}. This report is organised into seven chapters. Chapter~\ref{ch:lit_rev} details the literature review of this project. In Section~\ref{ch:method}...  % and so on.

\textbf{Note:}  Take care of the word like ``Chapter,'' ``Section,'' ``Figure'' etc. before the \LaTeX command \textbackslash ref\{\}. Otherwise, a  sentence will be confusing. For example, In \ref{ch:lit_rev} literature review is described. In this sentence, the word ``Chapter'' is missing. Therefore, a reader would not know whether 2 is for a Chapter or a Section or a Figure.
