abstract = {Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyse frauds in online transactions. The main aim of the paper is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method for Streaming Transaction Data, with an objective, to analyse the past transaction details of the customers and extract the behavioural patterns. Where cardholders are clustered into different groups based on their transaction amount. Then using sliding window strategy [1], to aggregate the transaction made by the cardholders from different groups so that the behavioural pattern of the groups can be extracted respectively. Later different classifiers [3],[5],[6],[8] are trained over the groups separately. And then the classifier with better rating score can be chosen to be one of the best methods to predict frauds. Thus, followed by a feedback mechanism to solve the problem of concept drift [1]. In this paper, we worked with European credit card fraud dataset.}

ABSTRACT = {Online transactions, medical services, financial transactions, and banking all have their share of fraudulent activity. The annual revenue generated by fraud exceeds $1 trillion. Even while fraud is dangerous for organizations, it may be uncovered with the help of intelligent solutions such as rules engines and machine learning. In this research, we introduce a unique hybrid technique for identifying financial payment fraud by combining nature-inspired-based Hyperparameter tuning with several supervised classifier models, as implemented in a modified version of the XGBoost Algorithm. At the outset, we split out a sample of the full financial payment dataset to use as a test set. We use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Records that are known to be illegitimate or fraudulent are predicted, while those that raise suspicion are further investigated using a number of machine learning algorithms. The models are trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Several tests using a dataset of actual financial transactions are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Frauds in credit card transactions are common today as most of us are using the credit card payment methods more frequently. This is due to the advancement of Technology and increase in online transaction resulting in frauds causing huge financial loss. Therefore, there is need for effective methods to reduce the loss. In addition, fraudsters find ways to steal the credit card information of the user by sending fake SMS and calls, also through masquerading attack, phishing attack and so on. This paper aims in using the multiple algorithms of Machine learning such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (Knn) and artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting the occurrence of the fraud. Further, we conduct a differentiation of the accomplished supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques to differentiate between fraud and non-fraud transactions.}

This study aims to investigate the present trends and identify the key challenges that require significant research efforts to increase the credibility of the technique. Additionally, we provide some recommendations to deal with these challenges.}

abstract = {Due to the growing volume of electronic payments, the monetary strain of credit-card fraud is turning into a substantial challenge for financial institutions and service providers, thus forcing them to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. However, modern data-driven and learning-based methods, despite their popularity in other domains, only slowly find their way into business applications. In this paper, we phrase the fraud detection problem as a sequence classification task and employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to incorporate transaction sequences. We also integrate state-of-the-art feature aggregation strategies and report our results by means of traditional retrieval metrics. A comparison to a baseline random forest (RF) classifier showed that the LSTM improves detection accuracy on offline transactions where the card-holder is physically present at a merchant. Both the sequential and non-sequential learning approaches benefit strongly from manual feature aggregation strategies. A subsequent analysis of true positives revealed that both approaches tend to detect different frauds, which suggests a combination of the two. We conclude our study with a discussion on both practical and scientific challenges that remain unsolved.}
